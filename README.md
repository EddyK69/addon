Home Assistant addon repository for PetHubLocal

1. Navigate in Home Assistant to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Up the top right with the 3 Dots select **Repositories** 
3. Add PetHubLocal Addon Repository: https://github.com/PetHubLocal/addon
4. In the Add-on Store a new repository **PetHubLocal Home Assistant Add-on** has now been added to the bottom so find the "Pet Hub Local" addon and click it.
5. Click on the "INSTALL" button.
6. **WAIT** as it can take up to 7 minutes for the add-on to deploy as it needs to download the Home Assistant Docker image, install OS packages and PIP install all the python packages. It takes a while so just get a coffee or something rather than navigating away from the install screen.
